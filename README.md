# Food-Search

# Description : 
My first VueJS application. A recipe application that allows users to view all recipes in the Food-API database and save them to your own list after authenicated.
Credentials:
Username:
"Username"
Password:
"Password"

# Functionality : 
You can sign in or sign up through the first two pages. You cant visit any other pages before authenicated, see above credentials. Once loggged in, the home page has a search bar where you can type a food you want to view. Next to the search bar, it has a ´Saved Recipes´ link that sends you to a page that lists all of your saved recipes. You can see more data on a recipe after clicking ´See recipe´. On this page you can save the recipe by clicking the ´+´ button and you can view the scores for this recipe. The saved recipes page is the exact same as your home page instead it only has your saved recipes.
